<ul>
    <li>Along the top, there are <tt>14</tt> digital Input/Output pins (numbered <tt>0-13</tt>).</li>
    <li><tt>6</tt> of those digital pins, which are marked by the tilde sign ~ are capable of doing what it is called <a href="IO/pwmIntro.html">Pulse Width Modulation</a>.</li>
    <li>Pin <tt>13</tt> is special in that it has a built-in LED. This is for convenience and testing purposes only really. You can use that on-board LED  by simply outputting to pin <tt>13</tt> - or it can be used as a standard I/O pin.</li>
    <li>On the bottom right are <tt>6</tt> analog input pins. These will read the value of analog sensors such a light-meter or variable resistors.</li>
    <li>On the bottom left next to the analog input pins are power pins. The only ones you really need to worry about are the ground pins (GND), <tt>3.3v</tt>, and <tt>5v</tt> power lines.</li>
    <li>Finally, the only switch found on the Arduino is a reset switch. This will restart whatever program it has in its memory.</li>
    <li>The Arduino has a set amount of memory, and if your program goes too large, the compiler will give you an error.</li>
</ul>

<h4>rxtxSerial</h4>
    There are two files: <tt>rxtxComm.jar</tt> and <tt>rxtxSerial.dll</tt>, which should be installed as follows:
<pre>
C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\bin\rxtxSerial.dll
C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\lib\ext\RXTXComm.jar
</pre>
    Many 64-bit Windows machines have both 32-bit and 64-bit browsers and 32-bit and 64-bit Java. On such machines, the 64-bit libraries should be installed as shown above. The correct path for the 32-bit RXTX libraries is as follows:
<pre>
C:\Program Files(x86)\Java\jre6\bin\rxtxSerial.dll
C:\Program Files(x86)\Java\jre6\lib\ext\RXTXComm.jar
</pre>
<p>    
    My Java application uses a <tt>dll</tt> library. How can I get it work from the .jar file?
The <tt>dll</tt> is in the project's sources folder. I have to include it in my jar, extract it at runtime (in the same directory of the jar) and load it.
