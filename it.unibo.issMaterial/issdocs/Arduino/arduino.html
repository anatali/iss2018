Arduino is a microcontroller on a circuit board which makes it easy to receive inputs and drive outputs.
</p><p>
Arduino’s underlying hardware works at the same level of
sophistication that engineers employ to build embedded devices. People already working
with microcontrollers are also attracted to Arduino because of its agile development
capabilities and its facility for quick implementation of ideas.
</p><p>
Software programs, called <b>sketches</b>, are created on a computer using the Arduino integrated
development environment (IDE). The IDE enables you to write and edit code
and convert this code into instructions that Arduino hardware understands. The IDE
also transfers those instructions to the Arduino board (a process called <i>uploading</i>).
</p><p>
The board can only control
and respond to electricity, so specific components are attached to it to enable it to
interact with the real world. These components can be <b>sensor</b>s 
(e,g, switches, accelerometers, and ultrasound distance), which convert some
aspect of the physical world to electricity so that the board can sense it, or <b>actuator</b>s,
(e.g. LEDs, speakers, motors, and displays) which get electricity from the board and convert it into something that changes the
world.  
</p><p>
The most popular boards contain a <b>USB connector</b> that is used to provide power and
connectivity for uploading your software onto the board.
