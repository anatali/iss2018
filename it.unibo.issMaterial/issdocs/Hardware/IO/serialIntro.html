One way to use pins and wires efficiently is to send information over them serially as sequences of bits. Such an interface is called a <i id="i">serial interface</i>. 
</p><p>    
On older PCs, an <b>RS-232</b> connection may be provided via a <b>DB-9</b> connector. A microcontroller will typically use a universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter (<b>UART</b>) to convert the contents of an 8-bit register into a sequence of bits for transmission over an RS-232 serial link.

Newer devices designed to connect to personal computers typically use universal serial bus (<b>USB</b>) interfaces, standardized by a consortium of vendors. <b>USB 1.0</b> appeared in 1996 and supports a data rate of 12 Mbits/sec. <b>USB 2.0</b> appeared in 2000 and supports data rates up to 480 Mbits/sec. <b>USB 3.0</b> appeared in 2008 and supports data rates up to 4.8 Gbits/sec. USB is electrically simpler than RS-232 and uses simpler, more robust connectors
</p><p>  
    
There are several other serial interfaces in use today, including for example <b>I2C</b> (interintegrated circuit), <b>SPI</b> (serial peripheral interface bus), <b>PCI</b> Express (peripheral component interconnect express), <b>FireWire</b>, <b>MIDI</b> (musical instrument digital interface), and serial versions of <b>SCSI</b>.
