    <h3 id="h3">The robot (meta)problem</h3>

<p>
A (differential drive) <b>robot</b> is able to execute a set of <b>move-commands</b>. 
A move-command can be sent by some element external to the robot, called <b>Mind</b>.
<p></p> 
    The robot Mind can run on the same computational support of the robot or on a different computational node. 
    In the first case we say the robot is controlled in <b>Embedded-mode</b>, while in second case 
    we say that the ronbot is controlled in <b>Avatar-mode</b>.
<p></p> 
    A sequence of movement commands emitted by the Mind is called a <b>Plan</b>.
    During the execution of a Plan, the robot must be able to:
    
    <ul>
    <li>react to <b>alarms</b> emitted by other Minds, by other robots,
     by sensors embedded in the robot or by external devices 
    (e.g. a <a href="../Radar/radarEntry.html">radar</a>);</li>
    <li>accept (as soon as possible) a command (called <b>Halt</b>) able to immediately
        block any movement in the robot, whatever be its current task, including the
        handling of an alarm.
    </li>
    </ul>
    
    The handling of an alarm can be a simple (atomic) move (e.g. a <tt>stop</tt>) or the execution of some <b>alternative plan</b>. When an alternative (alarm handling) plan is ternminated, the robot could return to (<b>resume</b>) the completion of the plan interrupted by the alarm.
