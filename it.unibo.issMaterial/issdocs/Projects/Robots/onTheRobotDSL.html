    <h3 id="h3">Some consideration on the robot DSL</h3>

<p>
     
    <ul>
    <li>The <tt>DSL</tt> is just a starting point. As any other language, it has its own limitations.
    The good new is that is quite easy to extend/modify the syntax and the tools  </li>
    <li>The semantics of the language is operationally expressed by the generated code.
    However, it could be expressed in some other specification, (e.g Z) or modelling (e.g. Maude) language associated with analysis tools </li>
   <li>The software factory built around the  <tt>DSL</tt> is an advanced form of reuse and it is a
   concrete way to "force" the <i id="i">architectural style</i> more appropriated for the 
   application domain
    </li>
   <li>The code generated is a way to overcome the <i id="i">abstraction gap</i> between the problem (domain)
   and the reference technology (Java, C++, ..). </li>
   <li>The abstraction gap is overcome in  "modular way" with reference to a set of (custom) frameworks like QActors, QEvents
   QStreams, each used for some peculiar subproblem. Of course, any other platform can be used to overcome the abstraction gap </li>
   <li>The idea of a robot as the executor of a set of (prefixed) plans could be viewed as
   the starting point for a <b>QAgent</b> framework. A QAgent cannot be reduced to a single finite state machine (<tt>FSM</tt>).
   Rather , it is a collection of <tt>FSM</tt>) (see 
   <a href="../../../../it.unibo.lab.robotUsage/src/it/unibo/robotUsage/interpreted/TaskCmdExecutor.java"><tt>TaskCmdExecutor</tt></a>) 
   managed by an interpreter
   (see <a href="../../../../it.unibo.xtext.robot.planned/srcMore/robotInterpreter.js"> <tt>intepreter</tt></a> )</li>
   <li>The idea of robot as a simple 'slave' that can execute move commands is now substituted by the idea of a robot
   as a "thing of internet" able to perceive events, to interact with remote "minds", to execute other tasks (e.g. take a picture) 
   to operate in autonomous way to cooperate with other and so on, along an "open ended" path (vision).</li>
