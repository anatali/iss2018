<h3 id="h3">Daily Scrum Meeting</h3>
    <p>
 It is a short gathering which
happens everyday and should not be longer than 15 minutes. It is held
always at the same time and in the same place to reduce complexity. 
The goal of this gathering is to synchronize activities and create a plan for
the next 24 hours.
 </p><p>
This is not a status reporting to report
to a manager. It is a time for self-organizing Team to share with each other
what is going on, to help them coordinate. 
In the Daily Scrum, one by one, each member of the Team  answers three question:
<ul>
<li> What did I do yesterday that helped the Development
Team meet the Sprint Goal?</li>
<li>What will I do today to help the Development Team meet
the Sprint Goal?</li>
<li>Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the Develop-
ment Team from meeting the Sprint Goal?</li>
</ul>
 </p><p>
The Team is responsible for conducing the Daily Scrum, and
the ScrumMaster has to ensures this. He has to teach the Team to keep it
within the 15-minute time-box. If it takes more, it means that is not being
conducted correctly.
 </p><p>
There should not be in-depth discussion during the Daily Scrum.
If discussion is
required it takes place immediately after it in one or more parallel follow-up
meeting,
