    <p>
The Product Backlog is a prioritized list of customer-centric features.
It is managed by the Product Owner and the Team picks features from it.
 </p><p>
It is dynamic, it
keeps evolving over the lifetime of the product in order to always meet the
customer requirements; it constantly changes to identify what the product
needs to be appropriate, competitive, and useful. At any point, the Product
Backlog is the single, definitive view of "everything that could be done by
the Team ever, in order of priority".
 </p><p>
Requirements never stop changing, so a Product
Backlog is a living artifact. Changes in business requirements,
market conditions, or technology may cause changes in the Prod-
uct Backlog.
 </p><p>
The Product Backlog contains features ("allow the user to remove items
from the cart"), but it also contains enhancements ("make the ngerprint
recognition faster"), research work ("investigate solutions for bring the soft-
ware on Ubuntu") or even bugs and releated xes ("x occasional error
message during successful login"). Product Backlog's entries are simply
called items. Items have a description, an order, an estimate and a value.
