    <p>
The Product Owner is the responsible for maximizing the return on invest-
ment (ROI) and the work of the Team. In order to do so, he or she has to
identify the features required by the client. In a perfect world, the Product
Owner and the client are the same person.     
</p><p>
In Scrum there is one and only one person who serves as Product Owner.   
</p><p>
The Product Owner is the sole person responsible for managing the Product
Backlog. This includes: identify and prioritize each feature, make it visible
and accessible for every person responsible for the product and to be sure
that the Team understand to the level needed every item of it. [
</p><p>
Together with the Team, the Product Owner decides and agrees on the items
to be implemented in the next Sprint. At the end of each Sprint, during the
Review Meeting, he has to approve or reject what has been implemented.
He can also give suggestions for the subsequent sprints.
