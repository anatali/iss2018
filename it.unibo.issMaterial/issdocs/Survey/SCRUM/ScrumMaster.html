    <p>
The ScrumMaster is a coach and a teacher. 
</p><p>
He has to explain, and most
importantly, convince the team to follow the Scrum process, without having
any authority over them. Of course, the Team knows that they have to
follow the framework, but to do so accordingly they have to follow the
ScrumMaster leadership. The ScrumMaster helps also the Team improve
the development process, in the Review Meetings.
</p><p>
Resolving the impediments is not an easy task. The ScrumMaster has to
sort out any issue with the client, with third-party-providers, other teams
or even with managers. Thus, he would have to be quite skilled in order to
know how to deal with this variety of areas eectively.
</p><p>        
 His work aims to support both the Team and the Product Owner.
