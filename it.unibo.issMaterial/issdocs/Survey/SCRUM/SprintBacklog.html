    <p>
The Sprint Backlog is the document agreed during the Sprint Planning
Meeting by the Team and the Product Owner. It contains the set
of items from the Product Backlog selected for the sprint. Furthermore,
for each item, it contains all the task necessary to complete it. The Sprint
Backlog represent the goal for the Sprint.
 </p><p>
As new work is required, the Development Team adds it to
the Sprint Backlog. As work is performed or completed, the
estimated remaining work is updated. When elements of the
plan are deemed unnecessary, they are removed. Only the De-
velopment Team can change its Sprint Backlog during a Sprint.
The Sprint Backlog is a highly visible, real-time picture of the
work that the Development Team plans to accomplish during the
Sprint, and it belongs solely to the Development Team.
