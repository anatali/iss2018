<h3 id="h3">Sprint Planning Meeting</h3>
    <p>
This takes place at the beginning of each Sprint, and it is meant to plan the
work that is going to be done. It is time-boxed to a maximum of 8 hours for
a one-month Sprint. It is generally divided into two parts: <i id="i">What</i> to do and
<i id="i">How</i> to do it. Product Owner, Team and ScrumMaster have to partecipate
to the meeting.
</p><p>
In the first part of the Sprint Planning, Product Owner and Team review
the <i id="i">high-priority</i> items in the Product Backlog.
The number of features to be implemented is decided by the Team.
Usually, these items will have been well-analyzed in a previous Sprint, so
that at this meeting there are only minor last-minute clarifying questions. 
</p><p>
At the end the first part, the Product Owner can leave since the "How to"
part is <i id="i">planned only by the Team</i>.
</p><p>

The second part of the Sprint Planning focuses on how to implement the
items that the Team decides to take on. The Team forecasts the amount of
items they can complete by the end of the Sprint, starting at the top of the
Product Backlog (high-priority items) and working down the list in order.
This is a key practice in Scrum: The <i id="i">Team decides</i> how much work it will
complete, rather than having assigned to them by the Product Owner. This
makes for a more reliable forecast because the Team is making it based on
its own analysis and planning.

</p><p>
After estimates determined, the Team breaks down the activities in tasks
which can be assignable to developers. Usually one developer is responsible
for one task, but there is no problem in more than one developer to be
involved in a single task. The idea here is for the whole time to be aware
of what is to be developed, ad most importantly, how it is going to be
developed. In theory, any member of the Team could develop any of the
discussed tasks.

</p><p>
By the end of the Sprint Planning, the Team should be able to explain
to the Product Owner and Scrum Master <i id="i">how it intends to work</i> 
as a self-organizing team to accomplish the Sprint Goal.
