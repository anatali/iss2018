    <p>
It is three-hours time-boxed for a one-month Sprint. The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to:
<ul>
<li>Inspect how the last Sprint went with regards to people,
relationships, process, and tools</li>
<li>Identify and order the major items that went well and potential improvements;</li>
<li>Create a plan for implementing improvements to the way
the Scrum Team does its work.</li>
</ul> 
Here lays the basis for continuous improvement. If this meeting is successfully executed, 
the Team will always be improving its development process.
If they have in mind that there are always things to be improved, this meeting is a never-ending need; 
although perfection is impossible, significant
improvements will be achieved throughout the product development.
  </p><p>
Many Teams hold retrospectives only focusing on problems, and that is too
bad. It can lead to people thinking of retrospectives as somewhat depressing
or negative events. Instead, the ScrumMaster must ensure that the meeting
also focus on positives or strengths.
