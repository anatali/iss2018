    <p>
At the end of each Sprint, two meetings are held, the Sprint Review Meeting
and the Sprint Retrospective Meeting.
  </p><p>
The Sprint Review, often mislabeled "demo", is a meeting at which all the
people related to the product take place; this people are: Product Owner,
Team members, ScrumMaster, customers, users, stakeholders, experts, ex-
ecutives and anyone else who is interested. It should not be longer than four
hour for a one-month Sprint.
  </p><p>
During the Sprint Review the Team presents to the Product Owner what
was developed, via a demo. The Product Owner, then, evaluates whether
he or she approves or rejects what was developed. Note that he can approve
the product even if it has bugs. As long as the product is something deliver-
able, the Product Owner can accept it and leave corrections for later Sprints.
Therefore, a critical element of the Review is an in-depth conversation be-
tween the Team and the Product Owner.
  </p><p>
There will be one or more computers in the Review room on
which people can inspect and use the live software (there is no slideware).
  </p><p>
Sprints may fail, either because the Product Owner does not like
what was shown or because the estimations were wrong and the time for
the development of the agreed items was not enough. If this happens the
Team must be aware of the failure and make its best to improve in the next
Sprint.
  </p><p>
The result of the Sprint Review is a revised Product Backlog that defines the
probable Product Backlog items for the next Sprint. The Product Backlog
may also be adjusted overall to meet new opportunities.
