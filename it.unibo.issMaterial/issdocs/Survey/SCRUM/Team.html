<h3 id="h3">Scrum Team</h3>
    <p>
The Team is the set of people who develops the product. They have to
implement what the Product Owner decides. 
</p><p>
the Team is "cross-functional" and "self-organizing". 
</p><p>
"Cross-functional" means that the Team has all the skills necessary in order to
build the features required. 
</p><p>
"Self-organizing" means that nobody will ever
tell the team how to implement the features, not even the ScrumMaster.
The Team decides how many items (from the Product Backlog) to build in
a Sprint.
</p><p>
Each member of the Team is recognized as a Developer. 
There are no fixed specialist titles in a group that adopts Scrum.
</p><p>
The Team should have between 3 to 9 people. The Product Owner and the
ScrumMaster are not part of the count.
