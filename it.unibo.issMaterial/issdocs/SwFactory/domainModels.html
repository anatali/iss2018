<b>Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software by Eric Evans </b>
</p><p>

Eric Evans has written a fantastic book on how you can make the design of your software match your mental model 
of the problem domain you are addressing.
</p><p>
His book is very compatible with XP. It is not about drawing pictures of a domain; it is about how you think of it, 
the language you use to talk about it, and how you organize your software to reflect your improving understanding of it. 
</p><p>
Eric thinks that learning about your problem domain is as likely to happen at the end of your project 
as at the beginning, and so refactoring is a big part of his technique.
</p><p>
The book is a fun read. Eric has lots of interesting stories, and he has a way with words. 
I see this book as essential reading for software developers-it is a future classic." 
</p><p>
- Ralph Johnson, author of Design Patterns </p><p>
"If you don't think you are getting value from your investment in object-oriented programming,
this book will tell you what you've forgotten to do. 
Eric Evans convincingly argues for the importance of domain modeling as the central focus of development 
and provides a solid framework and set of techniques for accomplishing it. 
This is timeless wisdom, and will hold up long after the methodologies du jour have gone out of fashion." 
</p><p>
-Dave Collins, author of Designing Object-Oriented User Interfaces </p><p>
"Eric weaves real-world experience modeling-and building-business applications into a practical, 
useful book. Written from the perspective of a trusted practitioner, 
Eric's descriptions of ubiquitous language, the benefits of sharing models with users, 
object life-cycle management, logical and physical application structuring, and the process 
and results of deep refactoring are major contributions to our field." 
</p><p>
-Luke Hohmann, author of Beyond Software Architecture </p><p>
"This book belongs on the shelf of every thoughtful software developer." 
</p><p>
-Kent Beck </p><p>
"What Eric has managed to capture is a part of the design process that experienced 
object designers have always used, but that we have been singularly unsuccessful as a group in 
conveying to the rest of the industry. 
We've given away bits and pieces of this knowledge...but we've never organized and systematized 
the principles of building domain logic. This book is important." 
</p><p>
-Kyle Brown, author of Enterprise Java(TM) Programming with IBM(R) WebSphere(R) </p><p>
The software development community widely acknowledges that domain modeling is central to software design. 
Through domain models, software developers are able to express rich functionality and translate 
it into a software implementation that truly serves the needs of its users. 
But despite its obvious importance, there are few practical resources that explain 
how to incorporate effective domain modeling into the software development process. 
Domain-Driven Design fills that need. 
</p><p>This is not a book about specific technologies. 
It offers readers a systematic approach to domain-driven design, presenting an extensive 
set of design best practices, experience-based techniques, and fundamental principles that 
facilitate the development of software projects facing complex domains. 
</p><p>
Intertwining design and development practice, this book incorporates numerous examples 
based on actual projects to illustrate the application of domain-driven design to real-world software development.
Readers learn how to use a domain model to make a complex development effort more focused and dynamic. 
</p><p>
A core of best practices and standard patterns provides a common language for the development team. 
A shift in emphasis-refactoring not just the code but the model underlying the code-in combination 
with the frequent iterations of Agile development leads to deeper insight into domains and enhanced 
communication between domain expert and programmer. Domain-Driven Design then builds on this foundation, 
and addresses modeling and design for complex systems and larger organizations.
</p><p>
Specific topics covered include:
<ul>
<li> Getting all team members to speak the same language </li>
<li> Connecting model and implementation more deeply  </li>
<li> Sharpening key distinctions in a model  </li>
<li> Managing the lifecycle of a domain object  </li>
<li> Writing domain code that is safe to combine in elaborate ways  </li>
<li> Making complex code obvious and predictable  </li>
<li> Formulating a domain vision statement  </li>
<li> Distilling the core of a complex domain  </li>
<li> Digging out implicit concepts needed in the model  </li>
<li> Applying analysis patterns  </li>
<li> Relating design patterns to the model  </li>
<li> Maintaining model integrity in a large system  </li>
<li> Dealing with coexisting models on the same project  </li>
<li> Organizing systems with large-scale structures  </li>
<li> Recognizing and responding to modeling breakthroughs  </li>
</ul> 
With this book in hand, object-oriented developers, system analysts, and designers 
will have the guidance they need to organize and focus their work, create rich and useful domain models, 
and leverage those models into quality, long-lasting software implementations.

<b>Implementing Domain-Driven Design by Vaughn Vernon</b>
</p><p>
"For software developers of all experience levels looking to improve their results, 
and design and implement domain-driven enterprise applications consistently with the best current state 
of professional practice, 
Implementing Domain-Driven Design will impart a treasure trove of knowledge hard won within the 
DDD and enterprise application architecture communities over the last couple decades." 
</p><p>
-Randy Stafford, Architect At-Large, Oracle Coherence Product Development </p><p>
"This book is a must-read for anybody looking to put DDD into practice." 
</p><p>
-Udi Dahan, Founder of NServiceBus </p><p>

Implementing Domain-Driven Design presents a top-down approach to understanding domain-driven design (DDD) 
in a way that fluently connects strategic patterns to fundamental tactical programming tools.
 Vaughn Vernon couples guided approaches to implementation with modern architectures, 
 highlighting the importance and value of focusing on the business domain while balancing technical considerations. 
 Building on Eric Evans' seminal book, Domain-Driven Design, the author presents practical DDD techniques 
 through examples from familiar domains. 
 </p><p>
 Each principle is backed up by realistic Java examples-all applicable to C# developers-and all content 
 is tied together by a single case study: the delivery of a large-scale Scrum-based SaaS system for 
 a multitenant environment. The author takes you far beyond "DDD-lite" approaches that embrace 
 DDD solely as a technical toolset, and shows you how to fully leverage DDD's "strategic design patterns" 
 using Bounded Context, Context Maps, and the Ubiquitous Language. 
 </p><p>
 Using these techniques and examples, you can reduce time to market and improve quality, 
 as you build software that is more flexible, more scalable, and more tightly aligned to business goals. 
 </p><p>
 Coverage includes
 <ul>
<li> Getting started the right way with DDD, so you can rapidly gain value from it </li>
<li> Using DDD within diverse architectures, including Hexagonal, SOA, REST, CQRS, Event-Driven, and Fabric/Grid-Based </li>
<li> Appropriately designing and applying Entities-and learning when to use Value Objects instead </li>
<li> Mastering DDD's powerful new Domain Events technique  </li>
<li> Designing Repositories for ORM, NoSQL, and other databases </li>
</ul>
