The original intent of
the Raspberry Pi foundation, back when they designed the Pi, was to make it programmable
through <b>Python</b>. And that is one possibility, but people have come up since with ways to
control the GPIO pins from <b>C/C++, Java, Ruby, Perl</b> and many other languages/technologies. 
</p><p> 
The WiringPi library was written by Gordon Henderson to allow <tt>GPIO</tt> communication from <b>C/C++</b> in a style
similar to the (Arduino) <a href="http://wiring.org.co/">Wiring</a>  programming language.
Some of the functions in the WiringPi library are designed to mimic those in the Arduino Wiring system.
The main difference is that the main loop of the program is not provided. 

</p><p> 
Many wrappers for WiringPi have been created since, which allow us to use other programming languages too for this
purpose. But there us also a command line utility simply named <i id="i">gpio</i> that llows us to to talk 
to the <tt>GPIO</tt> pins is from the command line or from Bash scripts.

<h4>Example: light up/down an LED</h4>
The LED connected to GPIO pin 5 (WiringPi numbering).
<pre>
gpio mode 5 out
gpio write 5 1
gpio write 5 0
</pre>
Before you can control the GPIO pins from command line or from shell scripts, you will need to install 
the <i id="i">gpio utility</i>  on your system.
</p><p> 
From a performance point of view, do not implement  complex <tt>GPIO</tt> control in
shell scripts, because the speed of the Linux shell and of the gpio utility is not so
great and the scripts can keep the CPU quite busy.

<h3>Basics</h3>
The compile line for <tt>C</tt> should include the library wiringPi. For example:
<pre>
-I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib -lwiringPi
</pre>

The program must include the library header file:
<pre>
#include &lt;wiringPi.h>
</pre>

The program must must initialise wiringPi by using (each  returns -1 if  the initialization of the <tt>GPIO</tt> has failed)  :
<pre>
int wiringPiSetup (void) ; //using wiringPi pin numbering
int wiringPiSetupGpio (void) ;  //using Broadcom <tt>GPIO</tt>  pin numbers directly
int wiringPiSetupSys (void) ; //uses native Broadcom and the <b>/sys/class/gpio</b> interface 
</pre>
The first two functions must be called with root privileges. 
The third can be called as a non-root (it does not access the hardware directly) user provided
the <tt>GPIO</tt> pins have been exported before using the <i>gpio</i> program.

<h4>General</h4>
<ul>
<li><tt>void pinMode (int pin, int mode);</tt> //mode=INPUT, OUTPUT, or PWM_OUTPUT. No effect when in Sys mode</li>
<li><tt>void digitalWrite (int pin, int value)</tt> //value= HIGH or LOW (1 or 0)</li>
<li><tt>void digitalWriteByte (int value)</tt> //still takes two write operations to the GPIO hardware</li>
<li><tt>void pwmWrite (int pin, int value)</tt> //value between 0 and 1024</li>
<li><tt>int digitalRead (int pin) ;</tt> //returns HIGH or LOW (1 or 0)</li>
<li><tt>void pullUpDnControl (int pin, int pud)</tt> //PUD_OFF (no pull up/down) PUD_DOWN (pull to ground)  PUD_UP (pull to 3.3v)</li>
<li><tt>wpiPinToGpio (int wPiPin)</tt> //returns the BCM_GPIO pin number of the supplied wiringPi pin</li>
</ul>

<h4>PWM control</h4>
<ul>
<li><tt>pwmSetMode (int mode) ;</tt> //PWM_MODE_BAL (balanced) or PWM_MODE_MS (mark:space) </li>
<li><tt>pwmSetRange (unsigned int range)</tt> //default is 1024</li>
<li><tt>pwmSetClock (int divisor)</tt></li>
</ul>

<h4>Timing</h4>
<ul>
<li><tt>unsigned int millis (void)</tt> //unsigned 32-bit number which wraps after 49 days 
(number if milliseconds since your program called one of the wiringPiSetup functions)</li>
<li><tt>void delay (unsigned int howLong)</tt> //maximum delay; an unsigned 32-bit integer
or approximately 49 days.</li>
<li><tt>void delayMicroseconds (unsigned int howLong)</tt> //maximum delay: an unsigned 32-bit integer
microseconds or approximately 71 minutes</li>
</ul>

<h4>Program/Thread Priority</h4>
This attempts to shift your program (or thread in a multi-threaded program) to a higher priority and
enables a real-time scheduling. 
<ul>
<li><tt>int piHiPri (int priority)</tt></li>
</ul>

The priority parameter should be from 0 (the default) to 99 (the
maximum). This will give a bigger slice of time when
other programs are running. The priority parameter works relative to others – so you can make one
program priority 1 and another priority 2 and it will have the same effect as setting one to 10 and the
other to 90 (as long as no other programs are running with elevated priorities)
The return value is 0 for success and -1 for error. 
Only programs running as root can change their priority. If called from a non-root program then
nothing happens.

<h4>Interrupts</h4>
With any kernel after June 2012 we can  wait for an interrupt in a program.
This function registers a function to received interrupts on the specified pin
(does not need root privileges to work).
</p><p> 
The function will be called when the interrupt triggers. When it is triggered, it’s cleared in the
dispatcher before calling your function, so if a subsequent interrupt fires before you finish your
handler, then it won’t be missed. (However it can only track one more interrupt, if more than one
interrupt fires while one is being handled then they will be ignored)
This function is run at a high priority (if the program is run using sudo, or as root) and executes
concurrently with the main program. It has full access to all the global variables, open file handles
and so on.

<ul>
<li><tt>int wiringPiISR (int pin, int edgeType, void (*function)(void)) ;</tt></li>
</ul>
The edgeType parameter
is either INT_EDGE_FALLING, INT_EDGE_RISING, INT_EDGE_BOTH or INT_EDGE_SETUP. If it
is INT_EDGE_SETUP then no initialisation of the pin will happen – it’s assumed that you have
already setup the pin elsewhere (e.g. with the gpio program), but if you specify one of the other
types, then the pin will be exported and initialised as specified.

<h4>Multi-threading</h4>
wiringPi has a simplified interface to the Linux implementation of Posix threads, as well as a
(simplified) mechanisms to access mutex’s (Mutual exclusions)

<pre>
PI_THREAD (myThread){
.. code here to run concurrently with the main program
}
//----------------------------------------
//Starts:
x = piThreadCreate (myThread) ;
if (x != 0)
	printf ("it didn't start\n")
</pre>
The thread can indicate an event, or action by using global variables to communicate back to the main
program, or other threads.

<ul>
<li><tt>int piThreadCreate (name)</tt> //creates a thread which is another function in your program previously declared using the
PI_THREAD declaration</li>
<li><tt>piLock (int keyNum)</tt></li>
<li><tt>piUnlock (int keyNum)</tt></li>
</ul>
